Sales-Profit-Analysis-Capstone using Excel, SQL and PowerBI
This repository contains my capstone project on Sales and Profit Analysis using Power BI, SQL, and Excel. The project focuses on analyzing sales trends, profit distribution, discount strategies, and segment-wise performance using real-world data. The analysis was conducted through Excel (for initial exploration), SQL (for database querying), and Power BI (for interactive visualizations).

This project aims to provide actionable insights into sales and profitability trends, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.
